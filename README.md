My name is Oleh and I am a beginner Python developer. I have been learning Python for about 3 month .
My projects:
License plate checker
This project uses Selenium and PyPasser to check license plates. The user can enter a license plate number and the program will check if the license plate is insured. 

Voice assistant
This project is a voice assistant that can perform a variety of tasks, such as pause/play music, shutdown pc,control volume,search in google or youtube, etc. The assistant is powered by SpeechRecognition library.

I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and learn new things. I am excited to continue working on these projects and to see what I can create in the future.
